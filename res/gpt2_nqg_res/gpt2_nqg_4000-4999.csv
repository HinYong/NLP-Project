If the answer is that solar ener",what is a common feature of passive solar architecture ?
983,"how is solar planning different from solar housing?
Solar planning does not mean ""the right design for your space needs are right for you"". Solar housing needs to be built for a climate/climate combination, the need for strong solar energy system or a very large, stable sun generating system. Solar ",what is produced when the features of passive solar architecture are customized to the environment ?

989,"how is the sun warming at these latitudes to avoid the temperature difference? i.e.,how would the sun cause a temperature change that results in a negative warming of atmospheric temperature, such as the heat that occurs in urban areas? 
A common theory, however, is that the heat from UQAs caused by",what materials absorb sunlight and create higher temperatures than natural materials ?
990,"how is a city built? What is the cost of building a building? How much does it cost to construct an actual ""cool communities'' like this one?
A simple solution, if you ask me; let's ask it now.
A very basic, but fairly elegant method is to construct a human building with an area of 4.5 megapascals. ",what is a way to reduce the high temperatures created in urban heat islands ?

Solar energy is not available for cultivation here in the world, but it is available for farms to consume as well as for livestock and soil. the only way to grow sunlight is either by growing a tree growing in a sun-drain, or by growing some oth","during the little ice age , what did english and french farmers use to increase collection of solar energy ?"
992,"how is solar energy being produced in the present day?
According to the current technology, where are the world's plants growing?and that is what we need for the current agricultural crop.
It will depend upon many different fields. we need to do various calculations, as they are constantly changing ",vinters have adopted solar technology to do what ?
993,"how is solar energy being produced in the present day? Solar energy is not being produced in order to achieve optimum crop yields. 
From another perspective, solar energy is being produced not through the production of the raw materials, but through the utilization of sunlight. the production of sol",why do agriculture and horticulture seek to make the most use of the solar energy captured ?
994,"how is solar energy being produced in the present day? Solar energy is not being produced by any other source than sunlight but by other activities that create large amounts of energy that could be used.
It will be appreciated in this chapter that although solar energy is being produced in the prese",what are some techniques used to improve crop production ?

Solar energy is not available for cultivation here in the world, but it is available for farms to consume as well as for livestock and soil. the only way to grow sunlight is either by growing a tree growing in a sun-drain, or by growing some oth",what did french and english farmers do during the little ice age to gain more solar energy ?
996,"how is solar energy being produced in the present day? Solar energy is not being produced by any other source than the sun. Its application for agriculture and other sectors of society for which the sun is the only energy source is that of energy consumed by plants or animals, not that which comes f",what was the purpose of the fruit walls built by french and english farmers ?
997,"how is the sun being produced locally? 
Based on the above context, generate the question whose answer is in the following sentences:primitive greenhouses were first used when European and Russian plants were planted in a zonal region. 
A common theory, however, is that the sun is being produced loc",when were the first greenhouses used ?
